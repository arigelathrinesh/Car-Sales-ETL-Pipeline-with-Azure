# Car-Sales-ETL-Pipeline-with-Azure
This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 to manage, transform, and organize car sales data from an external source (GitHub). The architecture follows the Bronze-Silver-Gold layered model commonly used in modern data lakehouse designs.
